## 1. Purpose
### Problem
Token launchpads are very popular - between 40,000 and 100,000 new tokens are launched every day generating a monthly revenue of \$60-100M. The highest percentage of these launches happened on Solana (Pump.fun) and on Binance Smart Chain (Four.meme). However, on average, only about 10 tokens per month reach a market cap of \$1M or more. 
### Cause
Tokens are launched to the general public without any prior vetting. This results in a large number of low-quality tokens being launched, which dilutes the market and makes it difficult for high-quality projects to gain traction. 
### Solution
A curated launchpad would help to solve this problem by providing a platform for high-quality projects to launch their tokens. This would help to increase the overall quality of tokens in the market, making it easier for investors to find and invest in promising projects. 
### Opportunity
EARN Launchpad is a multi-chain launchpad with an AI and community driven vetting mechanism and rewards system. This ensures that only high-quality projects are launched while also providing a platform for community members to earn rewards for their contributions. By leveraging AI and community input, EARN Launchpad aims to create a more efficient and effective launch process that benefits both projects and investors.

## 2. Core Vision

### EARN-based Liquidity Pools
The launchpad will be built around the deflationary multi-chain token EARN that will be used as the pairing token for all liquidity pools. This way, projects will be interconnected and benefit from the volatility across the different pools. This will generate volume for projects and the EARN token through arbitrage while powering the deflationary mechanism of EARN. 

### AI Vetting
The goal is to allow for a quick and efficient launch process while ensuring that only high-quality projects are launched. To accomplish this, the launchpad will leverage AI to analyze project submissions and provide initial vetting. 

### Community Involvement
After AI Vetting, the community will be able to overrule the AI decision and provide additional vetting. Community members will be rewarded for their contributions. Participants will be able to earn additional rewards by referring new users to the platform and by sharing their insights on social media.

### Governance & Rewards
Through staking of the EARN token, users will receive vEARN which will be used for governance and to access exclusive features on the launchpad. With vEARN, Users will be able to vote on which projects should be launched, with exclusive airdrops being distributed to those who participate in the vetting process. Users can boost their airdrop share by choosing longer staking lockup times, additional contribution through social media engagement and referrals. This approach not only helps to ensure that only high-quality projects are launched, but also creates a more engaged and invested community around the tokens being launched. 

### Conclusion
Together, EARN will become an index token for high-quality launches, with the value of EARN being directly tied to the success of the projects launched on the platform. This creates a strong incentive for users to hold and use EARN while also participating in the governance of the platform, as they will benefit from the growth and success of the projects launched on the platform.

## 3. Guiding Principles
Design decisions will favor modularity and auditability over rapid feature expansion — every component should be independently testable, replaceable, and observable. The following principles will guide the design and development of the launchpad:  

**Decentralization**: No single entity should control user funds or launch approvals.
**Transparency**: Every step of the process — from contribution to token distribution — must be verifiable on-chain.
**Composability**: Components (contracts, APIs, UIs) should be modular, so future projects or DAOs can reuse them.
**Security-first**:	Funds, user data, and on-chain interactions are always prioritized over speed or convenience.
**Simplicity before complexity**: Build clear, minimal components first; add advanced mechanics (bonding curves, DAOs, cross-chain) later.

## 4. Target Users
The following users are envisioned to interact with the launchpad:
**Project Creators**: Teams launching new tokens who need a reliable, trusted platform to reach investors.
**Contributor / Investors**: Individuals looking to discover and invest in vetted, high-potential tokens.
**EARN Holder / DAO Member**: EARN ecosystem participants who want to see utility and value growth of the EARN token through successful launches.

## 5. Long-term Goals
High-level objectives that the system should achieve over time:
- Enable multi-chain launches with seamless EARN token interoperability.
- Introduce dynamic bonding-curve pricing for token sales.
- Establish community governance via EARN DAO.
- Provide analytics and on-chain reputation tracking for project transparency.
- Integrate yield and liquidity products tied to the EARN ecosystem.
- Support referrals, and social rewards to boost project visibility.
- Support multi-chain tokens with custom bridge to generate additional revenue for the launchpad and EARN ecosystem.

## 6. System Overview (Vision-level Architecture)
The EARN Launchpad will consist of three major layers:

1. **Smart Contract Layer**: handles all funds, token logic, and on-chain verification.
2. **Application Layer**: backend and API services managing metadata, events, and automation.
3. **User Layer**: a frontend for interaction and a governance portal for EARN holders.

The system should be modular (upgradable in the beginning), allowing each layer to evolve independently while maintaining composability with the broader DeFi ecosystem.

## 7. Success Indicators
At a high level, success looks like:
- Real projects successfully raise and distribute funds through the platform.
- A vibrant community of contributors actively vet and support launches.
- The EARN token gains utility and value through its role in the launchpad ecosystem.

## 8. Key Challenges & Risks (to revisit later)
Following are some anticipated challenges:
- **Security**: Smart contracts must be rigorously audited to prevent exploits.
- **User Experience**: Balancing security and decentralization with a smooth user journey.
- **Community Engagement**: Sustaining active participation in vetting and governance.
- **Launch Quality**: Ensuring the vetting process effectively filters out low-quality projects without being overly restrictive.
- **Project Viability**: Attracting projects that have a strong potential for success and align with the launchpad's quality standards.

## 9. Connection to MVP
To realize this vision iteratively, the first milestone (MVP) will focus on delivering a single-chain, end-to-end launch flow.
This MVP will validate the architecture and serve as the foundation for scaling into a multi-chain, community-governed system.
